# UiO_EEG_analysis
EEG analysis for people who are familiar with excel but not with Matlab

The Project is under construction and focuses mainly on students who are interested in sophisticated EEG analyses but not good at programming. The analyses are based on several functions from EEGLAB, FieldTrip, or MATLAB signal processing toolbox. However, with this project there is no need to use a gui.

Description:
After you installed everything accordingly (installation_info.txt) and changed your eeglab path in the main script "eeganalysis" you should be good to go.
Use the latest updated CSV file from the private folder and change it according to the analyses you are interested in. Then, run the main script "eeganalysis" in matlab. It will ask you for the CSV file to load and hopefully everything works from then... but no garantees!
